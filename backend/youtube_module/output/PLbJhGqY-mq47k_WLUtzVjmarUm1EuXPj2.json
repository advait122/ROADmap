  "topic_overview": {
    "title": "DSA Patterns",
    "description": "DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. DSA Patterns refer to common techniques used to solve problems in coding interviews, especially those related to FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) companies. These patterns help developers approach complex problems in a structured way, making it easier to write efficient and effective code. DSA patterns are essential for anyone looking to crack coding interviews and improve their programming skills.",
    "importance": "DSA patterns are crucial for coding interviews, as they help developers solve problems efficiently and effectively. They are commonly used in various industries, including tech, finance, and more.",
    "common_usage": "DSA patterns are used in coding interviews, coding challenges, and real-world programming projects."
