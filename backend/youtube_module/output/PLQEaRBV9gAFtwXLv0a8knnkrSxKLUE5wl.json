  "topic_overview": {
    "title": "Binary Search Tree (BST)",
    "description": "A Binary Search Tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right). It's a tree-like structure where each node represents a value, and the left child node has a value less than its parent node, while the right child node has a value greater than its parent node. This structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of nodes.",
    "importance": "BSTs are commonly used in databases, file systems, and other applications where data needs to be efficiently searched, sorted, and updated. They're also a fundamental data structure in computer science, and understanding BSTs is essential for advancing in programming and software development.",
    "common_usage": "BSTs are used in various areas, including database indexing, file system organization, and algorithm design. They're also used in many programming languages and frameworks, making them a crucial concept to grasp for software developers and programmers."
