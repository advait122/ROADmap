  "topic_overview": {
    "title": "Trees in Data Structures",
    "description": "Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to organize and store data in a hierarchical manner. They are essential for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and storage in various applications, such as databases, file systems, and algorithms. Understanding trees is crucial for problem-solving and coding in areas like software development, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.",
    "importance": "Trees are used to represent complex relationships between data, enabling efficient searching, sorting, and manipulation. They are also used to model real-world scenarios, such as file systems, social networks, and organizational hierarchies.",
    "common_usage": "Trees are commonly used in various domains, including database systems, web development, artificial intelligence, and data science."
